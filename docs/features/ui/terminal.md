# Terminal
The terminal user interface is [compatible](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) with many different common terminals, across all supported operating systems, like [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) or [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

> Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> to suspend to shell while in the **UI**. Then type `exit` to resume the **UI**.

The **upper area** of the terminal shows the currently displayed file, any executed plugin and the current index and count of opened files.

The **lower area** of the terminal shows the current mode, any applied filters, the line count and the current UI state:

- `N` - show navigation
- `W` - wrap text
- `T` - tail file
